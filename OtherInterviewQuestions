1. What Happens When You Submit a Spark Job?
When you submit a Spark job, the following steps happen internally:

Step-by-Step Flow
Job Submission
You submit your application (using spark-submit or a notebook).
The Driver program starts.
Driver Program
The driver defines the Spark context and builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of stages and tasks.
It requests resources from the Cluster Manager (like YARN, Mesos, or Kubernetes).
Cluster Manager
The driver asks the cluster manager for resources (executors).
The cluster manager allocates containers/VMs on worker nodes.
Executor Launch
Executors (JVM processes) are started on worker nodes.
Executors run tasks and store data.
Task Scheduling
The driver breaks the job into stages and tasks (one per data partition).
Tasks are sent to executors.
Task Execution
Executors run tasks (map, filter, reduce, etc.) on data partitions.
Data may be shuffled between executors if needed (e.g., for joins).
Result Collection
Results are sent back to the driver (for actions like collect or count).
For output actions (like saveAsTextFile), data is written to storage.
Job Completion
Once all tasks finish, the job is marked complete.
Executors may stay alive for more jobs or shut down.

2. Spark Executor Memory Configuration (Simple Explanation)
Main Memory Areas
Executor Memory (spark.executor.memory): Main memory for tasks and caching.
Execution Memory: For computations (shuffles, joins, etc.).
Storage Memory: For caching RDDs/DataFrames.
These two areas can borrow from each other as needed.
Reserved Memory: Small fixed part for Spark’s internal use (default: 300MB).
Overhead: Extra buffer for JVM and system processes (default: 10% of executor memory, minimum 384MB).
Off-Heap Memory: Extra memory outside the JVM (disabled by default).
Simple Diagram
CopyInsert
[ Executor Container (Total Memory) ]
    ├── Reserved Memory (300MB)
    ├── Overhead (10% or min 384MB)
    └── Executor Memory (rest)
           ├── Execution Memory (for tasks)
           └── Storage Memory (for cache)
Quick Rules
Set spark.executor.memory for your tasks and caching.
Overhead and reserved memory are managed by Spark.
Execution and storage memory are dynamically managed, but you can tune them if needed.
Summary Table
| Memory Area | Purpose | How to Set / Default | |--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------| | Executor Memory | Tasks + Caching | spark.executor.memory | | Execution Memory | Computation (shuffles, joins) | Dynamic, part of executor memory | | Storage Memory | Caching RDDs/DataFrames | Dynamic, part of executor memory | | Reserved Memory | Internal Spark needs | 300MB (default) | | Overhead | JVM, user code, etc. | 10% of executor memory (min 384MB) | | Off-Heap | Special, outside JVM | Disabled by default |

Tip:
Usually, you only need to set spark.executor.memory and let Spark handle the rest unless you have special needs.
