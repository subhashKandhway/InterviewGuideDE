Okay, let's break down the SQL knowledge expected in Data Engineering interviews. This covers conceptual understanding, practical query writing (from basic to advanced), optimization, and data modeling aspects relevant to DE.

I. Core Concepts & Definitions

These questions test your fundamental understanding of SQL and database principles.

What is SQL? What does it stand for? (Structured Query Language)

What are the main subsets of SQL? (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, DQL - explain each briefly)

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP (tables, indexes, views, etc.)

DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DQL (Data Query Language): Often considered part of DML (SELECT)

DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE

TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

What is a Database? What is a Relational Database (RDBMS)?

What are the differences between a Database, a Data Warehouse, and a Data Lake? (Focus on structure, purpose, typical users, data types)

What is a Table? What are Rows and Columns?

What are Data Types in SQL? Give examples. (INT, VARCHAR, TEXT, DATE, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN, FLOAT/DECIMAL etc.)

What is a PRIMARY KEY? What are its properties? (Uniquely identifies a row, cannot be NULL)

What is a FOREIGN KEY? What is its purpose? (Enforces referential integrity between tables)

What is a UNIQUE constraint? How is it different from a PRIMARY KEY? (Ensures uniqueness, but can allow one NULL value - depending on RDBMS)

What is a NOT NULL constraint?

What is an INDEX? Why use it? What are the potential downsides? (Speeds up SELECT queries, slows down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; different types like B-Tree, Hash)

What is Normalization? What are the different Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)? Why is it important? (Reduces redundancy, improves data integrity)

What is Denormalization? When might you use it in Data Engineering (especially in Data Warehousing)? (Improves query performance by reducing joins, often used in analytical databases)

What is a VIEW? Why use it? (Stored query, simplifies complex queries, security)

What is a Stored Procedure? (Precompiled SQL code stored in the database)

What is a Trigger? (SQL code automatically executed in response to certain events like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

What are Transactions? What are the ACID properties? (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - Explain each)

What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?

DELETE: DML, removes rows one by one, can be rolled back, activates triggers, slower.

TRUNCATE: DDL, removes all rows at once, usually cannot be rolled back easily, doesn't activate triggers (usually), faster.

DROP: DDL, removes the entire table structure and data.

How do you handle NULL values? What is the difference between NULL and an empty string or 0? (IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, COALESCE, NULLIF)

What are Set Operators in SQL? (UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT/MINUS - explain differences, especially UNION vs UNION ALL)

II. Fundamental SQL Queries (DQL/DML)

These test your ability to write basic queries to retrieve and manipulate data. Assume sample tables like Employees, Departments, Orders, Customers, Products.

SELECT Statement:

SELECT * FROM TableName; (Select all columns)

SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM TableName; (Select specific columns)

SELECT DISTINCT Column1 FROM TableName; (Select unique values)

SELECT Column1 AS AliasName FROM TableName; (Using aliases)

WHERE Clause:

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE Condition; (Filtering rows)

Operators: =, >, <, >=, <=, != or <>, LIKE (%, _), IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL

Combining conditions: AND, OR, NOT

Example: Find employees in Department 'Sales' with salary > 50000.

SELECT EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Salary > 50000;


ORDER BY Clause:

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... ORDER BY Column1 ASC, Column2 DESC; (Sorting results)

LIMIT / TOP Clause:

SELECT ... FROM ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT 10; (Get top N rows - syntax varies by RDBMS)

Aggregate Functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TableName; (Count total rows)

SELECT COUNT(Column1) FROM TableName; (Count non-NULL values in Column1)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Column1) FROM TableName; (Count unique non-NULL values)

SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees; (Calculate average salary)

GROUP BY Clause: Used with aggregate functions to group rows with the same values.

Example: Find the number of employees in each department.

SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

HAVING Clause: Filters groups based on a specified condition (applied after GROUP BY).

Example: Find departments with more than 10 employees.

SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Key Question: What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING? (WHERE filters rows before aggregation, HAVING filters groups after aggregation).

III. Intermediate SQL Queries

These involve combining data from multiple tables or using more complex logic.

JOIN Operations: Crucial for combining data from related tables.

INNER JOIN: Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

Example: Get employee names and their department names.

SELECT E.EmployeeName, D.DepartmentName
FROM Employees E
INNER JOIN Departments D ON E.DepartmentID = D.DepartmentID;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table (or NULLs if no match).

Example: Get all departments and the employees in them (show departments even if they have no employees).

SELECT D.DepartmentName, E.EmployeeName
FROM Departments D
LEFT JOIN Employees E ON D.DepartmentID = E.DepartmentID;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table (or NULLs if no match).

FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns rows when there is a match in either table (includes all rows from both, with NULLs where no match exists).

CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables (all possible combinations of rows).

Self Join: Joining a table to itself.

Example: Find employees who have the same manager.

SELECT e1.EmployeeName AS Employee, e2.EmployeeName AS Manager
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Key Question: Explain the difference between INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

Subqueries (Nested Queries): Queries embedded within another SQL query.

In SELECT clause (Scalar Subquery - must return one value).

In FROM clause (Derived Table).

In WHERE clause (using IN, NOT IN, ANY, ALL, EXISTS, comparison operators).

Example: Find employees whose salary is above the company average.

SELECT EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Example: Find departments that have at least one employee.

SELECT DepartmentName
FROM Departments
WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DISTINCT DepartmentID FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID IS NOT NULL);
-- Or using EXISTS
SELECT DepartmentName
FROM Departments d
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Employees e WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID);
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Key Question: What is the difference between a correlated and a non-correlated subquery?

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Define temporary, named result sets that you can reference within a single SQL statement. Improves readability and modularity.

WITH clause.

Example: Rewrite the "salary above average" query using a CTE.

WITH AvgSalary AS (
    SELECT AVG(Salary) AS avg_sal FROM Employees
)
SELECT e.EmployeeName, e.Salary
FROM Employees e, AvgSalary av
WHERE e.Salary > av.avg_sal;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Recursive CTEs (less common in basic interviews, but good to know).

IV. Advanced SQL (Critical for Data Engineering)

These topics are frequently tested as they are heavily used in ETL/ELT, data analysis, and reporting within data warehouses.

Window Functions: Perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, they do not collapse rows.

Syntax: FUNCTION_NAME() OVER ( [PARTITION BY ...] [ORDER BY ...] [ROWS/RANGE BETWEEN ...] )

Ranking Functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), NTILE()

Example: Find the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department.

WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        EmployeeName,
        DepartmentID,
        Salary,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) as rnk
    FROM Employees
)
SELECT EmployeeName, DepartmentID, Salary
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE rnk <= 3;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Key Question: What's the difference between RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER()?

Value Functions: LAG(), LEAD()

Example: Find the difference between the current month's sales and the previous month's sales.

SELECT
    SaleMonth,
    MonthlySales,
    LAG(MonthlySales, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY SaleMonth) AS PreviousMonthSales,
    MonthlySales - LAG(MonthlySales, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY SaleMonth) AS SalesDifference
FROM MonthlySalesSummary;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Aggregate Window Functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX() used with OVER() clause.

Example: Calculate the running total of sales over time.

SELECT
    SaleDate,
    SaleAmount,
    SUM(SaleAmount) OVER (ORDER BY SaleDate ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS RunningTotalSales
FROM Sales;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Example: Calculate the percentage of each employee's salary relative to their department's total salary.

SELECT
    EmployeeName,
    DepartmentID,
    Salary,
    SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID) AS DepartmentTotalSalary,
    (Salary * 100.0 / SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID)) AS PctOfDeptSalary
FROM Employees;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

PIVOT / UNPIVOT Operations: Transforming data from rows to columns or vice versa. (Syntax varies significantly between RDBMS like SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL (using crosstab), or using CASE statements).

Example (Conceptual using CASE): Pivot sales data to show total sales per product for each year in columns.

SELECT
    ProductID,
    SUM(CASE WHEN SaleYear = 2022 THEN SaleAmount ELSE 0 END) AS Sales_2022,
    SUM(CASE WHEN SaleYear = 2023 THEN SaleAmount ELSE 0 END) AS Sales_2023
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ProductID;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Advanced Date/Time Manipulation: DATE_TRUNC, EXTRACT, DATE_PART, interval arithmetic (syntax varies).

String Manipulation: CONCAT/||, SUBSTRING, REPLACE, UPPER, LOWER, TRIM, LENGTH/LEN.

Handling Large Datasets: Understanding concepts like partitioning, bucketing (in Hive/Spark SQL), and how query structure impacts performance on large tables.

V. Performance Tuning & Optimization

Data Engineers often deal with large datasets and complex pipelines, so query performance is critical.

How would you identify a slow-running query? (Monitoring tools, execution logs)

What is an EXPLAIN PLAN (or EXPLAIN, EXECUTION PLAN)? How do you interpret its output? (Shows how the database executes the query: joins used, index usage, table scans, costs)

How can INDEXES improve performance? What columns are good candidates for indexing? (Columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, ORDER BY)

What are common reasons for slow queries? (Missing indexes, inefficient joins, full table scans, complex subqueries, outdated statistics, poor query structure)

How would you optimize a query like [give a sample slow query]? (Analyze EXPLAIN PLAN, add/modify indexes, rewrite the query - e.g., replace subquery with JOIN/CTE, avoid SELECT *, filter early, use appropriate join types).

What are database statistics? Why are they important for the query optimizer?

When might a full table scan be better than using an index? (When selecting a large percentage of the table's rows)

Difference between Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes?

VI. Data Modeling for Data Engineering

While not strictly SQL querying, understanding schema design is often tested.

What is Star Schema? What is Snowflake Schema? What are the pros and cons of each? (Common data warehouse modeling techniques; Fact tables, Dimension tables)

What are Fact tables and Dimension tables?

What are Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)? Explain different types (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3). (How to handle changes in dimension attributes over time)

How would you design a schema for [give a scenario, e.g., tracking user web activity, e-commerce sales]?

VII. Scenario-Based / Problem-Solving Questions

These combine multiple SQL concepts to solve a specific problem.

Find the second highest salary. (Use OFFSET/FETCH, DENSE_RANK, subquery)

Find duplicate emails in a customer table. (Use GROUP BY/HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)

Write a query to find employees who earn more than their managers. (Requires a self-join)

Calculate the median salary per department. (Requires window functions like PERCENTILE_CONT or NTILE, or complex self-joins/subqueries in older SQL versions)

Find users who made a purchase on three consecutive days. (Requires LAG/LEAD and date functions)

Calculate the month-over-month growth rate for sales. (Requires LAG)

Write a query to denormalize data from multiple tables into a flat structure suitable for reporting. (Requires multiple JOIN operations)

Given a table of user logins (user_id, login_timestamp), find the duration of each user's session. (More complex, might involve LAG/LEAD, session definitions)

Tips for Answering:

Think Aloud: Explain your thought process as you write the query.

Clarify: Ask questions about the schema, data types, or expected output if anything is unclear.

Write Readable SQL: Use aliases, proper indentation, and comments if necessary.

Consider Edge Cases: Think about NULLs, empty tables, duplicates.

Discuss Alternatives: Mention different ways to solve the problem and their trade-offs (e.g., subquery vs. CTE vs. window function).

Focus on Efficiency: Especially for DE roles, mention performance considerations (indexing, join order, filtering early).

Know Your Platform: Be aware that syntax can vary slightly between different SQL dialects (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Spark SQL). Mention if your solution is specific to one.

This list is comprehensive, covering the breadth and depth needed for most Data Engineering SQL interviews. Focus heavily on Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, CTEs, and Performance Tuning, as these are daily tools for a DE. Good luck!

Okay, you're right to ask. While the previous list is very comprehensive and covers the vast majority of what you'd encounter, we can add a few more nuances and specific areas, especially those leaning towards modern data warehousing, ETL/ELT processes, and platform specifics, which are highly relevant for Data Engineers.

Here are some additions and areas to emphasize further:

VIII. SQL for ETL/ELT Processes & Data Pipelines

This focuses on how SQL is used specifically within data movement and transformation jobs.

MERGE Statement (or UPSERT logic):

Concept: How do you efficiently insert new rows and update existing rows in a target table based on a source table in a single statement?

Query: Write a MERGE statement (syntax varies: SQL Server/Oracle MERGE, PostgreSQL INSERT ... ON CONFLICT, MySQL INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE).

-- Example (Conceptual - SQL Server/Oracle syntax)
MERGE INTO TargetTable T
USING SourceTable S
ON T.PrimaryKey = S.PrimaryKey
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET T.Column1 = S.Column1, T.Column2 = S.Column2 -- Add conditions if needed
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (PrimaryKey, Column1, Column2)
    VALUES (S.PrimaryKey, S.Column1, S.Column2)
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN -- Optional: Handle rows in target not in source
    DELETE;


Incremental Loading Strategies:

Concept: How would you use SQL to load only new or changed data since the last ETL run? (Often involves watermarking using timestamps or IDs).

Query: Show how to select source data based on a high-watermark timestamp or ID stored elsewhere (e.g., a control table).

-- Get the last successful load time
DECLARE @LastLoadTime DATETIME = (SELECT MAX(LastLoadTimestamp) FROM etl_control.LoadHistory WHERE TableName = 'SourceTable');

-- Select new/updated records
SELECT *
FROM SourceTable
WHERE UpdatedTimestamp > @LastLoadTime;

-- (Followed by INSERT or MERGE into the target)

SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Change Data Capture (CDC) - SQL Aspects:

Concept: While CDC is often a database feature, how might you query CDC tables (if exposed) or manually identify changes between two table snapshots using SQL?

Query: Use MINUS/EXCEPT or FULL OUTER JOIN to find differences.

-- Find rows in NewSnapshot but not OldSnapshot (New/Updated)
SELECT * FROM NewSnapshot
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM OldSnapshot;

-- Find rows in OldSnapshot but not NewSnapshot (Deleted/Updated - requires PK check)
SELECT * FROM OldSnapshot
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM NewSnapshot;

-- Or using JOIN (often better for identifying specific changes)
SELECT COALESCE(n.ID, o.ID) as ID, n.*, o.*
FROM NewSnapshot n
FULL OUTER JOIN OldSnapshot o ON n.ID = o.ID
WHERE n.ID IS NULL OR o.ID IS NULL OR n.SomeValue <> o.SomeValue; -- Compare relevant columns
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

download
Use code with caution.
SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Data Validation & Quality Checks:

Concept: How can you use SQL to perform data quality checks (e.g., check for NULLs in critical columns, validate formats, check referential integrity, detect duplicates)?

Query: Write queries using WHERE, GROUP BY/HAVING, CASE statements to flag bad data.

-- Check for NULL primary keys
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM YourTable WHERE PrimaryKey IS NULL;

-- Check for unexpected values in a status column
SELECT Status, COUNT(*) FROM YourTable GROUP BY Status HAVING Status NOT IN ('Active', 'Inactive', 'Pending');

-- Find duplicate business keys
SELECT BusinessKey, COUNT(*) FROM YourTable GROUP BY BusinessKey HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SQL
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

IX. Working with Semi-Structured Data (JSON/XML)

Increasingly common in modern data platforms (e.g., logs, API responses). Syntax varies heavily between platforms (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery).

Concept: How do you extract values from a JSON string stored in a database column? How do you flatten a JSON array into relational rows?

Query (Conceptual - show awareness of functions): Be prepared to discuss functions like:

JSON_VALUE / JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR (Extract a single scalar value)

JSON_QUERY / JSON_EXTRACT (Extract an object or array)

OPENJSON / JSON_TABLE / LATERAL FLATTEN (Parse JSON into rows/columns)

Path expressions (e.g., $.customer.address.city)

-- Example (Conceptual - varies greatly by platform)
-- Extract city from a JSON column 'payload'
SELECT JSON_VALUE(payload, '$.customer.address.city') AS City
FROM Orders;

-- Flatten an array of items
SELECT o.OrderID, items.*
FROM Orders o
CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN(input => o.payload, path => '$.items') items; -- Snowflake example syntax
-- or using OPENJSON (SQL Server), jsonb_array_elements (Postgres) etc.

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

X. Advanced/Platform-Specific Concepts

Mentioning awareness of these shows deeper knowledge relevant to specific ecosystems.

Materialized Views:

Concept: What are they? How do they differ from standard views? When are they useful (performance for complex, slow-changing queries)? What are the drawbacks (storage, refresh latency/cost)?

User Defined Functions (UDFs):

Concept: What are they (scalar, table-valued)? When might you create one instead of embedding logic directly in a query? (Reusability, complexity abstraction).

Platform-Specific Optimization/Features:

Concept: Are you familiar with features specific to platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks (Spark SQL)? Examples:

Snowflake: QUALIFY clause (alternative to ROW_NUMBER filtering), Time Travel, Clustering Keys.

BigQuery: STRUCT/ARRAY data types, Partitioning/Clustering nuances, Approximate Aggregation Functions (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT).

Redshift: Distribution Styles (DISTKEY), Sort Keys, VACUUM/ANALYZE.

Spark SQL: DataFrame operations vs SQL, Partitioning/Bucketing, Broadcast Joins hints.

Question: "How would you optimize this query specifically for [Platform X]?"

SQL Anti-Patterns:

Concept: What are common SQL practices that hurt performance or readability? (e.g., overusing correlated subqueries, SELECT *, unnecessary DISTINCT, using functions on indexed columns in WHERE clauses preventing index usage, treating SQL like procedural code within loops).

XI. SQL in the Broader Data Ecosystem

SQL vs. NoSQL: When might a NoSQL database be more appropriate than a relational SQL database? (Schema flexibility, horizontal scalability for specific workloads, key-value access patterns).

SQL in Orchestration Tools (Airflow, etc.): How is SQL typically executed within an orchestrator? (Using operators like PostgresOperator, SnowflakeOperator, passing parameters).

SQL for BI Tools: How do BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) generate SQL? Understanding this helps write performant views/tables for consumption.

Conclusion on Completeness:

Adding these sections makes the list even more comprehensive, particularly for modern DE roles that heavily involve:

Building robust ETL/ELT pipelines (MERGE, Incremental Loads, CDC handling, Validation).

Dealing with diverse data formats (JSON).

Leveraging features of specific cloud data warehouses/platforms.

Understanding the practical application of SQL within automation and tooling.

The original list provides a very strong foundation. These additions cover the more specialized, process-oriented, and platform-aware aspects that distinguish a good Data Engineer's SQL skillset. You should prioritize based on the specific job descriptions you are targeting, but awareness of these extra areas is definitely beneficial.

Okay, let's distill this down. The lists provided cover virtually everything you could reasonably be asked about SQL in a Data Engineering interview, from fundamentals to advanced application. If you understand and can apply the concepts in those lists, you will be very well-prepared.

However, you're asking for the most frequently asked questions or areas. Based on many DE interview experiences, here's a prioritized list of what tends to come up most often and should be your core focus:

Top Priority / Almost Guaranteed Topics:

JOINs (Especially INNER and LEFT):

Question: "Explain the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN."

Task: "Write a query to combine data from Table A and Table B to show [specific result]." (This will require choosing the correct JOIN type).

Why: Fundamental for combining data from relational sources, a daily task.

Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY and HAVING:

Question: "What is the difference between the WHERE clause and the HAVING clause?"

Task: "Write a query to find the total sales/count of users/average value per department/category/month, only showing groups that meet a certain condition (e.g., more than 10 orders)."

Why: Essential for summarizing data and deriving insights.

Window Functions (Especially Ranking & LAG/LEAD):

Question: "Explain the difference between ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK()."

Task: "Write a query to find the top N records per category (e.g., top 3 employees by salary in each department)."

Task: "Write a query to calculate the change in a metric compared to the previous period (e.g., month-over-month sales difference)."

Why: Extremely powerful for complex analytical tasks common in DE (ranking, time-series analysis) without complex self-joins. This is a key differentiator for strong candidates.

CTEs (Common Table Expressions - WITH clause):

Question: "What is a CTE and why would you use one?"

Task: Many complex query tasks will be much easier and more readable if solved using CTEs. Interviewers often look for this structure.

Why: Improves query readability and organization for multi-step logic.

Basic Query Optimization & Indexing Concepts:

Question: "How would you investigate a slow-running query?" (Expected answer: EXPLAIN PLAN).

Question: "What is an index and how can it speed up a query? When might it slow things down?"

Task: Less often a direct coding task, more conceptual understanding or discussing how to optimize a given query.

Why: DEs work with large data; performance matters immensely.

Difference between DELETE / TRUNCATE / DROP:

Question: "Explain the differences between these commands."

Why: Tests understanding of DML vs DDL and operational implications (rollback, performance, triggers).

Handling NULL:

Question: "How do you filter for NULL values? How might you replace NULLs?" (IS NULL, COALESCE, ISNULL)

Why: NULLs are pervasive and need careful handling in calculations and joins.

Scenario-Based Problem Solving:

Task: Rather than asking for definitions, they give you a problem description and ask you to write the SQL to solve it. This will combine multiple concepts above (e.g., "Find customers who ordered product X but not product Y" - requires joins/subqueries/set operators; "Find the second highest salary" - requires ranking/subquery/limit+offset).

Important Secondary Topics (Frequently Asked, but maybe not every time):

Subqueries (vs. JOINs/CTEs): Understanding where they fit and potential performance implications.

Data Types: Basic understanding is usually sufficient.

Primary Keys / Foreign Keys: Core relational concepts.

UNION vs UNION ALL: Common point of confusion.

ETL/ELT Specific Logic: MERGE/Upsert logic, SCD Type 2 concepts (especially for data warehousing roles).

Star/Snowflake Schema: Basic understanding for data warehousing roles.

Is that really all?

For the SQL portion of a Data Engineering interview, yes, mastering the topics listed (especially the "Top Priority" ones) covers the vast majority of what you'll face. The comprehensive lists provided earlier include edge cases, deeper theory, and platform specifics that are great for demonstrating seniority or specialized knowledge but might not be strictly necessary to pass, especially for junior/mid-level roles.

Key Takeaway: Focus intensely on being able to write correct and reasonably efficient SQL queries for scenarios involving Joins, Aggregations, and Window Functions, using CTEs for clarity. Be ready to discuss basic optimization concepts. If you can nail those practical application areas, you'll be in a very strong position for the SQL round.
